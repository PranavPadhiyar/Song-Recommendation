# Spotify Song Recommendation

**Problem:**
Music streaming platforms often rely on general popularity and metadata to suggest new music to their users, sometimes leading to 
irrelevant and unsatisfying recommendations. Our music recommender website built on statistical analysis of audio features will provide 
relevant recommendations to users based on the unique characteristics of each song, improving the music discovery experience for all users, 
regardless of their listening history.

**Significance:**
The significance of our music recommender system built on statistical analysis of audio features lies in its ability to provide relevant 
and satisfying music recommendations to users, even in the absence of personal listening history data.
